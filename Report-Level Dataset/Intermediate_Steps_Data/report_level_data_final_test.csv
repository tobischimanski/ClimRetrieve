4,"ForewordEnabling sustainability for our company,  our customers, and the world2022 marked the sixth warmest year in history. Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future. As we look toward 2030—and beyond—we remain optimistic about our collective ability to decarbonize the global economy while continuing to grow and prosper as a global community.  4 |  |  | Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Brad Smith, Vice Chair and PresidentMicrosoft’s approach to addressing the climate crisis starts with the sustainability of our own business.

5,"In 2020, we made a bold set of commitments: to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company that protects ecosystems—all by 2030. Three years into this journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment. 2022 was a reminder that to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change, our commitments need to extend beyond our four walls, and we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to come.In 2022 we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade sustainability management tools. We also helped to advance a set of global sustainability initiatives that aim to benefit every person and organization on the planet. These include accelerating the availability of new climate technologies through our Climate Innovation Fund, strengthening our climate policy agenda, helping to develop a more reliable and interoperable carbon accounting system, advocating for skilling programs to expand the green workforce, and working to enable a just transition for the vulnerable populations of the global south.We believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but also recognize that the climate crisis can’t be solved by any single company, organization, or government. The global community needs partnerships, new innovations, policies, and global commitment to ensure a healthy future for all.A closer look at 2022Getting our own house in orderMicrosoft’s own sustainability is our first sphere of influence, and we remain focused on getting our own house in order and delivering on our 2030 commitments.

6,"We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear. These commitments are rooted in science and take the necessary steps to protect our ecosystems and prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. In addition to our long-term focus, it’s important to pause and evaluate our progress in 2022.In 2022, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent. This in part is a result of a reduction in our direct operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 22.7 percent. At Microsoft, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for less than four percent of total emissions, while indirect emissions, or Scope 3, account for more than 96 percent. Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. The more positive outcomes in 2022 are the result of improvements in our operations, real-time device telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs).",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company reference external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.3583061889250814,3
7,"While we continue to work to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero, Scope 3 is the ultimate decarbonization challenge. It necessitates the co-evolution of best practices for business, technology, and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made our carbon negative commitment in 2020 it wasn’t just a challenge to support the sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation to the world to participate in this journey, translating ingenuity into action, and action into impact.In addition to our carbon negative commitment, we’ve also made encouraging progress toward our 2030 commitments in water, waste, and ecosystems:Water positive We contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefits, increasing our running total of replenishment projects to 35 million m3. Additionally, we provided more than 850,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. Zero waste We increased our reuse and recycle rates of all cloud hardware to 82 percent and continue to pace toward our 2030 reuse and recycle goal of 90 percent. We also reduced single-use plastics across all Microsoft product packaging to 3.3 percent and are on track to eliminate their use by 2025.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company reference external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.3583061889250814,3
8,"We also reduced single-use plastics across all Microsoft product packaging to 3.3 percent and are on track to eliminate their use by 2025. In total, we have diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills. Ecosystem protection  We continue to maintain our commitment to protect more land than we use. In 2022, 12,000 of the over 17,000 acres of contracted land were officially designated as protected. The amount of land protected in 2022 exceeds the approximately 11,200 acres of land we currently use.Amplifying our impact and helping our customers achieve more Our second sphere of influence is customer sustainability. As a technology company, we have a role to play with the thousands of corporate customers who put their trust in Microsoft technology. The majority of our customers have already made a climate pledge and Microsoft is working to help them move from pledges to progress. While Microsoft’s emissions footprint is a tiny percentage of global emissions, we also have a role to play in helping reduce or remove the other 99.97 percent of global emissions. It’s important that our approach to sustainability extends beyond our own four walls and supports the sustainability needs of our customers.  Foreword (continued)Companies can only manage what they can measure, and Microsoft is committed to helping our customers measure their environmental impact in a timely and accurate manner. In June 2022, we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company reference external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.4744525547445255,3
9,"In June 2022, we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager. These new digital tools can interoperate with virtually any business system and unify data intelligence for organizations at any stage of their sustainability journey. Sustainability Manager enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades to the Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID), which helps customers to understand the emissions impact that results from their use of the Microsoft Cloud. The EID estimates Microsoft’s direct and indirect emissions related to a customer’s cloud usage, as well as the emissions customers have avoided by running workloads in the cloud rather than on-premises. In 2022, we also released a preview version of the Microsoft Planetary Computer to enable customers to measure, monitor, and subsequently to manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations, and to make important decisions related to climate risk. The Planetary Computer draws on more than 60 petabytes of open-source geospatial data. This data, when combined with the analytic capabilities of our AI for Good Lab, delivers a new level of planetary insights to corporations and governments around the world.

10,"Just as the reach of Microsoft technology extends to almost every country in the world, so should the impact of our sustainability programs. In November 2022, the world’s climate leaders convened for COP27. There were important conversations at COP27 focused on the uneven impacts of climate change and how the least developed countries in the world are disproportionately affected. For example, the nations of Africa together account for less than 5 percent of global emissions but have experienced far more than their share of the negative impacts of climate change. At Microsoft, we are focused on climate policies and programs that will have a positive impact on all eight billion inhabitants of planet Earth. PolicyMicrosoft is deeply committed to using our voice to influence sustainability policies around the world. We support public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reporting, reduction and removal, the transition to clean energy, water access and stress reduction, and the ability to measure, manage, and protect ecosystems. In 2022, we further committed to shaping public policy by releasing policy briefs on carbon and electricity. Carbon measurement and the Carbon CallIn February 2022, Microsoft, ClimateWorks Foundation, and over 20 leading organizations launched an important new initiative called the Carbon Call. T he objective of this program is to unify the world around a carbon accounting system that is more reliable and interoperable. ClimateWorks Foundation is building this program to a global scale.

12,"Climate Innovation FundWe believe that innovation is a critical component to solving the climate crisis, and that the investment of capital plays an important role in accelerating the availability of new solutions. Microsoft is investing in accelerating climate innovation through our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund (CIF). We invest in innovative technologies and business models that have the potential for meaningful, measurable climate impact by 2030. Since the founding of the CIF in 2020, Microsoft has allocated more than $600 million into a global portfolio of more than 50 investments, including sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems. Africa data labIn November we announced an expansion of our AI for Good Lab into Egypt and Kenya, building a new team of data scientists on the ground in Africa that will work to improve climate resilience. The work of these data labs will be informed by a new Africa AI Innovation Council comprised of representatives from leading African organizations.Sustainability skillsDelivering on the ambition of the Paris Agreement will require a global initiative focused on the proliferation of sustainability skills throughout the labor market. In November 2022, Microsoft and BCG released a new report, Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap: Helping Businesses Move from Pledges to Progress .

17,"How we workFor any organization’s environmental sustainability journey, it is critical to set commitments, develop a strategy, and build an operational roadmap—all while measuring progress and ensuring accountability. We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center  of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a  step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world  needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and  achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2Consider all positions of influence  As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals. We also focus on the larger impact that we can have with research, investments, innovation, strategic partnerships, policy, and advocacy. 3Establish sustainability as part of culture  At the heart of the Microsoft culture is the belief that for Microsoft to continue to do well, the world around us also needs to do well.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company reference external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.3805668016194332,3

As we continue to grow, we are pursuing opportunities that help solve the problems of people and the planet—and we have made sustainability core to our brand and our business. Our senior leadership team has a deep and enduring commitment to sustainability, which sets the tone across all levels of our organization. 4Make it central to business  To move from pledges to progress, Microsoft set commitments and built sustainability into the strategy, operations, and roadmaps of each business group and every subsidiary across the globe. We are also working across our value chain on sustainability commitments and support our customers and partners by delivering capacity-building tools and solutions. 5Ensure governance and accountability  Governance and accountability are critical to ensure cross-company alignment and prioritization of sustainability commitments. At Microsoft, we hold our business groups accountable for their carbon emissions via an internal carbon fee. Achieving our sustainability commitments is a core priority for every business group; we publish scorecards twice yearly and review progress quarterly. We established a Climate Council of senior leaders across the company to govern our sustainability progress and priorities. 6Report on everything, not just progress  Transparency needs to be a component of any sustainability initiative.

Operationally, we see this commitment as a journey that starts with reducing carbon emissions as much as possible, replacing our electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain. In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent. Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO 2e) (market-based and management-defined criteria for Scope 3  Category 11). Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO 2e. More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources.

23,"We saw a 0.5 percent increase in our Scope 3 emissions this year based on investments in real-time device telemetry-based measurement, improvements in our operations and supply chain, and purchases of renewable energy. As the world transitions to a lower-carbon, clean energy economy, we’re using our purchasing and investing power to help advance innovation and the development of new solutions—helping us meet our own commitments while catalyzing the creation of broader market supply for others. We fund purchases of renewable energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal through our internal carbon fee, which we established in 2012.

This includes deals across 16 countries including New Zealand, the Netherlands, Chile, Singapore, Austria, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Globally, we have more than 135 renewables projects in our PPA portfolio and are positioned to continue to grow our renewable resource procurement to meet our goals. Committing to environmental justice in carbon-free energy procurementIn addition to carbon-free energy, Microsoft has made commitments to diversity and inclusion , and to racial equity . An important point of intersection for these is environmental justice. To support environmental justice outcomes in a reimagined energy sector, Microsoft is in its third year of modeling approaches that link our carbon-free energy commitments with community-led clean energy and resiliency projects. Through partnerships, we have established new renewable energy procurement models that create new opportunities for frontline communities by equitably distributing the benefits of the clean energy economy. We’ve shared our lessons learned in a position paper  with Volt Energy Utility, including an Environmental Justice Measurement & Evaluation Framework  that guides our initiatives. Examples of how we’ve worked to integrate equity and justice into our approaches include the following:• We supported the development of two new community solar gardens in Illinois, which are expected to have a capacity of 4.75 MW with a focus on expanding access to renewable power to traditionally under-resourced populations.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company reference external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.3344262295081967,3

Solstice pioneered EnergyScore , a unique solution that uses utility payment history and other customer data to provide a more accurate and inclusive prediction of an individual’s ability to pay an energy bill. Once fully subscribed, the two solar gardens could save Illinois subscribers more than $100,000 a year in total electricity costs, while also reducing carbon emissions equivalent to more than 1,000 households’ average electricity usage. • We supported a 6.6-MW solar facility in Panola County, Mississippi, which provides first-time solar access to consumers in a county with majority Black residents and a poverty rate that is double the United States average. By using emissions data to determine where new solar generation can displace the most carbon, Clearloop  is collaborating with Microsoft to expand access to clean energy in a state that currently relies on fossil fuels to power nearly 90 percent of its electricity.

Water is a resource that every person and business on this planet needs to survive. We can use as little water in a location as possible and replenish more than we use, yet that basin can still be highly stressed and not provide local communities with what they need. 2 Replenishment needs to evolve  and scale if companies are going  to meet their goals Replenishment is a nascent market with limited guidance on what it means, how to account for benefits, how to make credible claims, and how to ensure replenishment investments are having a significant impact in high-stressed basins. Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical  piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come.

Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future. As we look toward 2030—and beyond—we remain optimistic about our collective ability to decarbonize the global economy while continuing to grow and prosper as a global community.  4 |  |  | Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Brad Smith, Vice Chair and PresidentMicrosoft’s approach to addressing the climate crisis starts with the sustainability of our own business.

5,"In 2020, we made a bold set of commitments: to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company that protects ecosystems—all by 2030. Three years into this journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment. 2022 was a reminder that to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change, our commitments need to extend beyond our four walls, and we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to come.In 2022 we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade sustainability management tools. We also helped to advance a set of global sustainability initiatives that aim to benefit every person and organization on the planet. These include accelerating the availability of new climate technologies through our Climate Innovation Fund, strengthening our climate policy agenda, helping to develop a more reliable and interoperable carbon accounting system, advocating for skilling programs to expand the green workforce, and working to enable a just transition for the vulnerable populations of the global south.We believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but also recognize that the climate crisis can’t be solved by any single company, organization, or government. The global community needs partnerships, new innovations, policies, and global commitment to ensure a healthy future for all.A closer look at 2022Getting our own house in orderMicrosoft’s own sustainability is our first sphere of influence, and we remain focused on getting our own house in order and delivering on our 2030 commitments.

6,"We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear. These commitments are rooted in science and take the necessary steps to protect our ecosystems and prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. In addition to our long-term focus, it’s important to pause and evaluate our progress in 2022.In 2022, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent. This in part is a result of a reduction in our direct operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 22.7 percent. At Microsoft, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for less than four percent of total emissions, while indirect emissions, or Scope 3, account for more than 96 percent. Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. The more positive outcomes in 2022 are the result of improvements in our operations, real-time device telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs).",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Does the company have a strategy on waste management?,"To meet our commitment to being zero waste by 2030, we are reducing, reusing, and recovering waste in our campuses and datacenters.",0,0.4357142857142857,3
7,"While we continue to work to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero, Scope 3 is the ultimate decarbonization challenge. It necessitates the co-evolution of best practices for business, technology, and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made our carbon negative commitment in 2020 it wasn’t just a challenge to support the sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation to the world to participate in this journey, translating ingenuity into action, and action into impact.In addition to our carbon negative commitment, we’ve also made encouraging progress toward our 2030 commitments in water, waste, and ecosystems:Water positive We contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefits, increasing our running total of replenishment projects to 35 million m3. Additionally, we provided more than 850,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come.

17,"How we workFor any organization’s environmental sustainability journey, it is critical to set commitments, develop a strategy, and build an operational roadmap—all while measuring progress and ensuring accountability. We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center  of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a  step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world  needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and  achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2Consider all positions of influence  As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals. We also focus on the larger impact that we can have with research, investments, innovation, strategic partnerships, policy, and advocacy. 3Establish sustainability as part of culture  At the heart of the Microsoft culture is the belief that for Microsoft to continue to do well, the world around us also needs to do well.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Does the company have a strategy on waste management?,"To meet our commitment to being zero waste by 2030, we are reducing, reusing, and recovering waste in our campuses and datacenters.",0,0.4247104247104247,3

In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent. Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO 2e) (market-based and management-defined criteria for Scope 3  Category 11). Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO 2e. More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources.

Overall, our Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent in FY22 compared to FY21. This is attributed to a few notable carbon reduction initiatives. First, we’ve extended the useful life of servers and network equipment from four to six years, resulting in a decrease in emissions related to Capital Goods. Second, we introduced a new telemetry-driven methodology to help us account for the energy consumption from our Surface devices and our rapidly growing base of Xbox users. This new data led us to purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset a portion of the emissions footprint from these devices.

We are investing in water reduction technologies including thermal energy, cooling technologies,  and air-to-water generation. Saving water through thermal energy Our Thermal Energy Center in Redmond is predicted to save over 37,850 m3 of water per year through several unconventional approaches to heat rejection. The geoexchange field transfers heat into the ground, which is approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The system’s wells and tanks will store water as heat energy for future use, instead of expelling it through the cooling towers, which is expected to reduce water use by 30,280 m3 a year or roughly the volume of 12 Olympic pools.

Water is a resource that every person and business on this planet needs to survive. We can use as little water in a location as possible and replenish more than we use, yet that basin can still be highly stressed and not provide local communities with what they need. 2 Replenishment needs to evolve  and scale if companies are going  to meet their goals Replenishment is a nascent market with limited guidance on what it means, how to account for benefits, how to make credible claims, and how to ensure replenishment investments are having a significant impact in high-stressed basins. Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical  piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come.

Improving cloud resource utilization We use resource oversubscription and harvesting techniques to optimize the utilization of energy-consuming cloud resources. We address oversubscription by using statistical analysis to predict when additional virtual machines can be deployed on underutilized hardware. Our approach to oversubscription is enabled by a technique called harvesting. It enables us to opportunistically create a new type of virtual machine to apply underutilized resources to oversubscribed situations. We are currently applying oversubscription and harvesting to Microsoft internal virtual machines for CPU resources, and will be expanding this capability into other energy-intensive resources such as memory, networking, and storage.

162,"Microsoft has allocated over $600 million into a global portfolio of more than 50 investments, including sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems. Our investments are selected based on four principles: the technology's potential for climate impact, the company's inclusion in an otherwise underfunded market, the investment's impact on climate equity, and the investment's alignment with Microsoft's own operational needs. We think broadly about the impact of our CIF investments. We invest to help Microsoft achieve our own operational needs, accelerate the development of technologies that will help our customers and partners, and rapidly increase the scale of the global sustainability market. Microsoft has a unique perspective in the market for climate technologies. In addition to investments made through CIF, we are also a buyer in carbon, water, and waste solutions, and a donor of grant capital. We have enabled a portfolio of climate innovations that have a collective potential for climate impact that we believe is far greater than any individual approach can achieve by itself. Investing in water and resilience Every community deserves an opportunity to prosper in this new world, and many of the negative effects of climate change will be a result of water scarcity.

As we work internally and with other companies, it's clear that the impact on business will be significant and will require a workforce equipped to work on a broad range of sustainability projects. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates 18 million net-new jobs will be created by 2030 as a result of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. To better understand how to close the sustainability skills gap, Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group studied the work of 15 companies at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change—including across Microsoft itself. Our teams interviewed and surveyed nearly 250 employees whose jobs have sustainability commitments incorporated into their role. We identified new jobs that have emerged, studied the impact on jobs that already exist, and identified in-demand knowledge and skills. To meet these sustainability commitments, a vital effort is needed to equip companies and employees with a broad range of new skills needed for sustainability transformation. We published the Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap  report to share what we have learned.

Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future. As we look toward 2030—and beyond—we remain optimistic about our collective ability to decarbonize the global economy while continuing to grow and prosper as a global community.  4 |  |  | Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Brad Smith, Vice Chair and PresidentMicrosoft’s approach to addressing the climate crisis starts with the sustainability of our own business.

Three years into this journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment. 2022 was a reminder that to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change, our commitments need to extend beyond our four walls, and we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to come.In 2022 we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade sustainability management tools. We also helped to advance a set of global sustainability initiatives that aim to benefit every person and organization on the planet. These include accelerating the availability of new climate technologies through our Climate Innovation Fund, strengthening our climate policy agenda, helping to develop a more reliable and interoperable carbon accounting system, advocating for skilling programs to expand the green workforce, and working to enable a just transition for the vulnerable populations of the global south.We believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but also recognize that the climate crisis can’t be solved by any single company, organization, or government. The global community needs partnerships, new innovations, policies, and global commitment to ensure a healthy future for all.A closer look at 2022Getting our own house in orderMicrosoft’s own sustainability is our first sphere of influence, and we remain focused on getting our own house in order and delivering on our 2030 commitments.

6,"We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear. These commitments are rooted in science and take the necessary steps to protect our ecosystems and prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. In addition to our long-term focus, it’s important to pause and evaluate our progress in 2022.In 2022, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent. This in part is a result of a reduction in our direct operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 22.7 percent. At Microsoft, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for less than four percent of total emissions, while indirect emissions, or Scope 3, account for more than 96 percent. Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. The more positive outcomes in 2022 are the result of improvements in our operations, real-time device telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs).",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Does the company identify any impacts of its business activities on the environment?,"Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth.",2,1.0,2
7,"While we continue to work to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero, Scope 3 is the ultimate decarbonization challenge. It necessitates the co-evolution of best practices for business, technology, and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made our carbon negative commitment in 2020 it wasn’t just a challenge to support the sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation to the world to participate in this journey, translating ingenuity into action, and action into impact.In addition to our carbon negative commitment, we’ve also made encouraging progress toward our 2030 commitments in water, waste, and ecosystems:Water positive We contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefits, increasing our running total of replenishment projects to 35 million m3. Additionally, we provided more than 850,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. Zero waste We increased our reuse and recycle rates of all cloud hardware to 82 percent and continue to pace toward our 2030 reuse and recycle goal of 90 percent.

The amount of land protected in 2022 exceeds the approximately 11,200 acres of land we currently use.Amplifying our impact and helping our customers achieve more Our second sphere of influence is customer sustainability. As a technology company, we have a role to play with the thousands of corporate customers who put their trust in Microsoft technology. The majority of our customers have already made a climate pledge and Microsoft is working to help them move from pledges to progress. While Microsoft’s emissions footprint is a tiny percentage of global emissions, we also have a role to play in helping reduce or remove the other 99.97 percent of global emissions. It’s important that our approach to sustainability extends beyond our own four walls and supports the sustainability needs of our customers.

9,"In June 2022, we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager. These new digital tools can interoperate with virtually any business system and unify data intelligence for organizations at any stage of their sustainability journey. Sustainability Manager enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades to the Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID), which helps customers to understand the emissions impact that results from their use of the Microsoft Cloud. The EID estimates Microsoft’s direct and indirect emissions related to a customer’s cloud usage, as well as the emissions customers have avoided by running workloads in the cloud rather than on-premises. In 2022, we also released a preview version of the Microsoft Planetary Computer to enable customers to measure, monitor, and subsequently to manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations, and to make important decisions related to climate risk. The Planetary Computer draws on more than 60 petabytes of open-source geospatial data.

In November 2022, the world’s climate leaders convened for COP27. There were important conversations at COP27 focused on the uneven impacts of climate change and how the least developed countries in the world are disproportionately affected. For example, the nations of Africa together account for less than 5 percent of global emissions but have experienced far more than their share of the negative impacts of climate change. At Microsoft, we are focused on climate policies and programs that will have a positive impact on all eight billion inhabitants of planet Earth.

17,"How we workFor any organization’s environmental sustainability journey, it is critical to set commitments, develop a strategy, and build an operational roadmap—all while measuring progress and ensuring accountability. We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center  of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a  step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world  needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and  achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2Consider all positions of influence  As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals.

Overall, our Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent in FY22 compared to FY21. This is attributed to a few notable carbon reduction initiatives. First, we’ve extended the useful life of servers and network equipment from four to six years, resulting in a decrease in emissions related to Capital Goods. Second, we introduced a new telemetry-driven methodology to help us account for the energy consumption from our Surface devices and our rapidly growing base of Xbox users. This new data led us to purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset a portion of the emissions footprint from these devices.

Water is a resource that every person and business on this planet needs to survive. We can use as little water in a location as possible and replenish more than we use, yet that basin can still be highly stressed and not provide local communities with what they need. 2 Replenishment needs to evolve  and scale if companies are going  to meet their goals Replenishment is a nascent market with limited guidance on what it means, how to account for benefits, how to make credible claims, and how to ensure replenishment investments are having a significant impact in high-stressed basins. Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical  piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come. If we continue with the status quo, we will not protect freshwater resources for future generations. Organizations need to innovate within their own operations, supply chain, and the communities in which they operate by investing in solutions that maximize efficiency and reduce dependence on freshwater resources.

4,"ForewordEnabling sustainability for our company,  our customers, and the world2022 marked the sixth warmest year in history. Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future. As we look toward 2030—and beyond—we remain optimistic about our collective ability to decarbonize the global economy while continuing to grow and prosper as a global community.  4 |  |  | Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Brad Smith, Vice Chair and PresidentMicrosoft’s approach to addressing the climate crisis starts with the sustainability of our own business.

5,"In 2020, we made a bold set of commitments: to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company that protects ecosystems—all by 2030. Three years into this journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment. 2022 was a reminder that to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change, our commitments need to extend beyond our four walls, and we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to come.In 2022 we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade sustainability management tools. We also helped to advance a set of global sustainability initiatives that aim to benefit every person and organization on the planet. These include accelerating the availability of new climate technologies through our Climate Innovation Fund, strengthening our climate policy agenda, helping to develop a more reliable and interoperable carbon accounting system, advocating for skilling programs to expand the green workforce, and working to enable a just transition for the vulnerable populations of the global south.We believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but also recognize that the climate crisis can’t be solved by any single company, organization, or government. The global community needs partnerships, new innovations, policies, and global commitment to ensure a healthy future for all.A closer look at 2022Getting our own house in orderMicrosoft’s own sustainability is our first sphere of influence, and we remain focused on getting our own house in order and delivering on our 2030 commitments. We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Does the company report a plan to engage with downstream partners on water consumption or water pollution?,"For Microsoft, being net water positive means we will reduce water consumption across our global operations, replenish more water than we use, provide people across the globe with access to water and sanitation services, drive innovation, and engage in water policy",0,0.3054187192118227,2
6,"We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear. These commitments are rooted in science and take the necessary steps to protect our ecosystems and prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. In addition to our long-term focus, it’s important to pause and evaluate our progress in 2022.In 2022, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent. This in part is a result of a reduction in our direct operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 22.7 percent. At Microsoft, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for less than four percent of total emissions, while indirect emissions, or Scope 3, account for more than 96 percent. Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. The more positive outcomes in 2022 are the result of improvements in our operations, real-time device telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs).",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Does the company report a plan to engage with downstream partners on water consumption or water pollution?,"We take a holistic approach to water reduction across our campuses and datacenters from design to efficiency in existing systems, recycling and repurposing, and innovating new technologies. ",0,0.33994334277620397,2
7,"While we continue to work to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero, Scope 3 is the ultimate decarbonization challenge. It necessitates the co-evolution of best practices for business, technology, and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made our carbon negative commitment in 2020 it wasn’t just a challenge to support the sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation to the world to participate in this journey, translating ingenuity into action, and action into impact.In addition to our carbon negative commitment, we’ve also made encouraging progress toward our 2030 commitments in water, waste, and ecosystems:Water positive We contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefits, increasing our running total of replenishment projects to 35 million m3. Additionally, we provided more than 850,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. Zero waste We increased our reuse and recycle rates of all cloud hardware to 82 percent and continue to pace toward our 2030 reuse and recycle goal of 90 percent. We also reduced single-use plastics across all Microsoft product packaging to 3.3 percent and are on track to eliminate their use by 2025.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Does the company report a plan to engage with downstream partners on water consumption or water pollution?,"For Microsoft, being net water positive means we will reduce water consumption across our global operations, replenish more water than we use, provide people across the globe with access to water and sanitation services, drive innovation, and engage in water policy",0,0.36533957845433257,2
8,"We also reduced single-use plastics across all Microsoft product packaging to 3.3 percent and are on track to eliminate their use by 2025. In total, we have diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills. Ecosystem protection  We continue to maintain our commitment to protect more land than we use. In 2022, 12,000 of the over 17,000 acres of contracted land were officially designated as protected. The amount of land protected in 2022 exceeds the approximately 11,200 acres of land we currently use.Amplifying our impact and helping our customers achieve more Our second sphere of influence is customer sustainability. As a technology company, we have a role to play with the thousands of corporate customers who put their trust in Microsoft technology. The majority of our customers have already made a climate pledge and Microsoft is working to help them move from pledges to progress. While Microsoft’s emissions footprint is a tiny percentage of global emissions, we also have a role to play in helping reduce or remove the other 99.97 percent of global emissions. It’s important that our approach to sustainability extends beyond our own four walls and supports the sustainability needs of our customers.

9,"In June 2022, we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager. These new digital tools can interoperate with virtually any business system and unify data intelligence for organizations at any stage of their sustainability journey. Sustainability Manager enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades to the Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID), which helps customers to understand the emissions impact that results from their use of the Microsoft Cloud. The EID estimates Microsoft’s direct and indirect emissions related to a customer’s cloud usage, as well as the emissions customers have avoided by running workloads in the cloud rather than on-premises. In 2022, we also released a preview version of the Microsoft Planetary Computer to enable customers to measure, monitor, and subsequently to manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations, and to make important decisions related to climate risk. The Planetary Computer draws on more than 60 petabytes of open-source geospatial data. This data, when combined with the analytic capabilities of our AI for Good Lab, delivers a new level of planetary insights to corporations and governments around the world.

10,"Just as the reach of Microsoft technology extends to almost every country in the world, so should the impact of our sustainability programs. In November 2022, the world’s climate leaders convened for COP27. There were important conversations at COP27 focused on the uneven impacts of climate change and how the least developed countries in the world are disproportionately affected. For example, the nations of Africa together account for less than 5 percent of global emissions but have experienced far more than their share of the negative impacts of climate change. At Microsoft, we are focused on climate policies and programs that will have a positive impact on all eight billion inhabitants of planet Earth. PolicyMicrosoft is deeply committed to using our voice to influence sustainability policies around the world. We support public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reporting, reduction and removal, the transition to clean energy, water access and stress reduction, and the ability to measure, manage, and protect ecosystems. In 2022, we further committed to shaping public policy by releasing policy briefs on carbon and electricity. Carbon measurement and the Carbon CallIn February 2022, Microsoft, ClimateWorks Foundation, and over 20 leading organizations launched an important new initiative called the Carbon Call.

We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center  of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a  step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world  needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and  achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2Consider all positions of influence  As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals.

Operationally, we see this commitment as a journey that starts with reducing carbon emissions as much as possible, replacing our electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain. In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent. Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO 2e) (market-based and management-defined criteria for Scope 3  Category 11). Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO 2e. More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources.

Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical  piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come.

We originally developed this technology to help farmers make better operational decisions, such as when to plant or spray, especially in the face of changing weather patterns. This technology is included in FarmVibes.AI , but is broadly applicable to other industries that must adapt to climate change. For example, logistics and supply chains can be affected by hyperlocal weather events, causing ripple effects throughout many industries, such as retail, manufacturing, and transport. Renewable energy production forecasts are also highly dependent on local weather, affecting renewable energy operators as well as managers of electricity grids. Modeling carbon flow Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves extracting carbon dioxide from sources like industrial emissions, then liquefying and storing it underground or undersea. CCS relies on equation-based models that predict the suitability of a storage site, such as its storage capacity and risk of leakage.

Pursuing climate solutions through computational foundations The Microsoft Climate Research Initiative (MCRI) , launched in June 2022, aims to advance the computational foundations, partnerships, and tools needed to achieve a carbon negative future globally. Together with external sustainability experts, Microsoft scientists identified fundamental bottlenecks to mitigating and adapting  to the climate crisis. To pursue solutions, researchers then narrowed their focus to bottlenecks for which computational approaches, such as those pursued by AI4Science, could be transformative. From this analysis, researchers selected three priority focus areas: reliable accounting of carbon emissions, materials engineering for carbon removal and reduction, and climate risk assessment. MCRI now supports projects in these three areas with collaboration between Microsoft researchers and external academics and is establishing a global community of research partners to complement Microsoft's internal computational expertise and infrastructure.

We're using AI to identify materials that can lead to such improvements. Metal-organic frameworks are a class of materials that can balance the tradeoff between adsorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the energy required to release the adsorbed molecules for cost-effective storage or reuse. Researchers at Microsoft and the University of California, Berkeley are collaborating to use AI methods to find optimal metal-organic materials that balance this tradeoff and offer other properties required for economic and safe carbon removal. Strengthening nature-based solutions for climate Restoring and protecting nature is vital to reaching net zero, while building resilience to climate change is already underway. However, it can be difficult to properly measure and account for the climate benefit of investments in nature. We are collaborating with scientists and research institutions around the world to improve measurement and accounting methods for nature's contribution to climate solutions.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates 18 million net-new jobs will be created by 2030 as a result of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. To better understand how to close the sustainability skills gap, Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group studied the work of 15 companies at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change—including across Microsoft itself. Our teams interviewed and surveyed nearly 250 employees whose jobs have sustainability commitments incorporated into their role. We identified new jobs that have emerged, studied the impact on jobs that already exist, and identified in-demand knowledge and skills.

Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future.

These new digital tools can interoperate with virtually any business system and unify data intelligence for organizations at any stage of their sustainability journey. Sustainability Manager enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades to the Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID), which helps customers to understand the emissions impact that results from their use of the Microsoft Cloud. The EID estimates Microsoft’s direct and indirect emissions related to a customer’s cloud usage, as well as the emissions customers have avoided by running workloads in the cloud rather than on-premises. In 2022, we also released a preview version of the Microsoft Planetary Computer to enable customers to measure, monitor, and subsequently to manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations, and to make important decisions related to climate risk. The Planetary Computer draws on more than 60 petabytes of open-source geospatial data. This data, when combined with the analytic capabilities of our AI for Good Lab, delivers a new level of planetary insights to corporations and governments around the world.

We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center  of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a  step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world  needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and  achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2Consider all positions of influence  As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals.

Water is a resource that every person and business on this planet needs to survive. We can use as little water in a location as possible and replenish more than we use, yet that basin can still be highly stressed and not provide local communities with what they need. 2 Replenishment needs to evolve  and scale if companies are going  to meet their goals Replenishment is a nascent market with limited guidance on what it means, how to account for benefits, how to make credible claims, and how to ensure replenishment investments are having a significant impact in high-stressed basins. Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical  piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come.

Microsoft designs a growing portion of its own hardware portfolio, and we make sustainability considerations a key part of the entire Microsoft Azure hardware design process—including energy efficiency, repairability, upgradability, and durability. To enact these principles at scale, we developed a patent-pending Intelligent Disposition and Routing System (IDARS) that establishes and executes a zero waste plan for our cloud hardware assets. IDARS is an end-to-end system that identifies the most sustainable disposition path for every part at any point in its lifecycle across the supply chain. Paired with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Microsoft Power Platform, IDARS utilizes the bill of materials of assets, inventory, and demand to optimize the sustainable path, and provides Circular Center technicians with precise instructions on how to steward the asset onto its next phase.

We are now able to fuse historical weather forecasts with local sensor data to more accurately predict weather parameters in a specific microclimate. We originally developed this technology to help farmers make better operational decisions, such as when to plant or spray, especially in the face of changing weather patterns. This technology is included in FarmVibes.AI , but is broadly applicable to other industries that must adapt to climate change. For example, logistics and supply chains can be affected by hyperlocal weather events, causing ripple effects throughout many industries, such as retail, manufacturing, and transport. Renewable energy production forecasts are also highly dependent on local weather, affecting renewable energy operators as well as managers of electricity grids.

Pursuing climate solutions through computational foundations The Microsoft Climate Research Initiative (MCRI) , launched in June 2022, aims to advance the computational foundations, partnerships, and tools needed to achieve a carbon negative future globally. Together with external sustainability experts, Microsoft scientists identified fundamental bottlenecks to mitigating and adapting  to the climate crisis. To pursue solutions, researchers then narrowed their focus to bottlenecks for which computational approaches, such as those pursued by AI4Science, could be transformative. From this analysis, researchers selected three priority focus areas: reliable accounting of carbon emissions, materials engineering for carbon removal and reduction, and climate risk assessment. MCRI now supports projects in these three areas with collaboration between Microsoft researchers and external academics and is establishing a global community of research partners to complement Microsoft's internal computational expertise and infrastructure.

We're using AI to identify materials that can lead to such improvements. Metal-organic frameworks are a class of materials that can balance the tradeoff between adsorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the energy required to release the adsorbed molecules for cost-effective storage or reuse. Researchers at Microsoft and the University of California, Berkeley are collaborating to use AI methods to find optimal metal-organic materials that balance this tradeoff and offer other properties required for economic and safe carbon removal. Strengthening nature-based solutions for climate Restoring and protecting nature is vital to reaching net zero, while building resilience to climate change is already underway. However, it can be difficult to properly measure and account for the climate benefit of investments in nature. We are collaborating with scientists and research institutions around the world to improve measurement and accounting methods for nature's contribution to climate solutions.

As we work internally and with other companies, it's clear that the impact on business will be significant and will require a workforce equipped to work on a broad range of sustainability projects. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates 18 million net-new jobs will be created by 2030 as a result of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. To better understand how to close the sustainability skills gap, Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group studied the work of 15 companies at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change—including across Microsoft itself. Our teams interviewed and surveyed nearly 250 employees whose jobs have sustainability commitments incorporated into their role. We identified new jobs that have emerged, studied the impact on jobs that already exist, and identified in-demand knowledge and skills. To meet these sustainability commitments, a vital effort is needed to equip companies and employees with a broad range of new skills needed for sustainability transformation.

Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future.

6,"We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear. These commitments are rooted in science and take the necessary steps to protect our ecosystems and prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. In addition to our long-term focus, it’s important to pause and evaluate our progress in 2022.In 2022, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent. This in part is a result of a reduction in our direct operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 22.7 percent. At Microsoft, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for less than four percent of total emissions, while indirect emissions, or Scope 3, account for more than 96 percent. Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. The more positive outcomes in 2022 are the result of improvements in our operations, real-time device telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs).",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company align with external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.3583061889250814,3
7,"While we continue to work to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero, Scope 3 is the ultimate decarbonization challenge. It necessitates the co-evolution of best practices for business, technology, and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made our carbon negative commitment in 2020 it wasn’t just a challenge to support the sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation to the world to participate in this journey, translating ingenuity into action, and action into impact.In addition to our carbon negative commitment, we’ve also made encouraging progress toward our 2030 commitments in water, waste, and ecosystems:Water positive We contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefits, increasing our running total of replenishment projects to 35 million m3. Additionally, we provided more than 850,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. Zero waste We increased our reuse and recycle rates of all cloud hardware to 82 percent and continue to pace toward our 2030 reuse and recycle goal of 90 percent.

In 2022, 12,000 of the over 17,000 acres of contracted land were officially designated as protected. The amount of land protected in 2022 exceeds the approximately 11,200 acres of land we currently use.Amplifying our impact and helping our customers achieve more Our second sphere of influence is customer sustainability. As a technology company, we have a role to play with the thousands of corporate customers who put their trust in Microsoft technology. The majority of our customers have already made a climate pledge and Microsoft is working to help them move from pledges to progress. While Microsoft’s emissions footprint is a tiny percentage of global emissions, we also have a role to play in helping reduce or remove the other 99.97 percent of global emissions. It’s important that our approach to sustainability extends beyond our own four walls and supports the sustainability needs of our customers.

9,"In June 2022, we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager. These new digital tools can interoperate with virtually any business system and unify data intelligence for organizations at any stage of their sustainability journey. Sustainability Manager enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades to the Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID), which helps customers to understand the emissions impact that results from their use of the Microsoft Cloud. The EID estimates Microsoft’s direct and indirect emissions related to a customer’s cloud usage, as well as the emissions customers have avoided by running workloads in the cloud rather than on-premises. In 2022, we also released a preview version of the Microsoft Planetary Computer to enable customers to measure, monitor, and subsequently to manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations, and to make important decisions related to climate risk. The Planetary Computer draws on more than 60 petabytes of open-source geospatial data. This data, when combined with the analytic capabilities of our AI for Good Lab, delivers a new level of planetary insights to corporations and governments around the world.

In November 2022, the world’s climate leaders convened for COP27. There were important conversations at COP27 focused on the uneven impacts of climate change and how the least developed countries in the world are disproportionately affected. For example, the nations of Africa together account for less than 5 percent of global emissions but have experienced far more than their share of the negative impacts of climate change. At Microsoft, we are focused on climate policies and programs that will have a positive impact on all eight billion inhabitants of planet Earth. PolicyMicrosoft is deeply committed to using our voice to influence sustainability policies around the world. We support public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reporting, reduction and removal, the transition to clean energy, water access and stress reduction, and the ability to measure, manage, and protect ecosystems. In 2022, we further committed to shaping public policy by releasing policy briefs on carbon and electricity. Carbon measurement and the Carbon CallIn February 2022, Microsoft, ClimateWorks Foundation, and over 20 leading organizations launched an important new initiative called the Carbon Call.

We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center  of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a  step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world  needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and  achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2Consider all positions of influence  As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals. We also focus on the larger impact that we can have with research, investments, innovation, strategic partnerships, policy, and advocacy. 3Establish sustainability as part of culture  At the heart of the Microsoft culture is the belief that for Microsoft to continue to do well, the world around us also needs to do well.",2022 Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Report.pdf,Do the environmental/sustainability targets set by the company align with external climate change adaptation goals/targets?,"As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy.",0,0.3805668016194332,3

Water is a resource that every person and business on this planet needs to survive. We can use as little water in a location as possible and replenish more than we use, yet that basin can still be highly stressed and not provide local communities with what they need. 2 Replenishment needs to evolve  and scale if companies are going  to meet their goals Replenishment is a nascent market with limited guidance on what it means, how to account for benefits, how to make credible claims, and how to ensure replenishment investments are having a significant impact in high-stressed basins. Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical  piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come. If we continue with the status quo, we will not protect freshwater resources for future generations. Organizations need to innovate within their own operations, supply chain, and the communities in which they operate by investing in solutions that maximize efficiency and reduce dependence on freshwater resources.
