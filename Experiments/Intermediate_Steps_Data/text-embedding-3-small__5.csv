4,"Access to  healthcareEnvironmental protectionEthics and  transparency3Sustainability  overviewSustainability overviewChief Executive Officer’s statement When we come together,  we can transform the  delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero.Healthcare is our common foundation. It’s the bedrock of society, and when we’re healthy, communities thrive and economies prosper. Yet, with ageing populations, the rising burden of chronic disease and the growing impact of the climate crisis on health, health systems are struggling to meet people’s health needs. And around the world, inequities in healthcare are growing from low- to high-income countries, with vulnerable populations the most affected. We must recognise the strong correlation between healthy people and a healthy planet – the science is clear. The number of heat-related deaths could more than triple by 2050 without significant action, and we’re witnessing a steep rise in heart and metabolic conditions, cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to environmental factors. The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate-health crisis in 2023.  With the healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions, we must significantly reduce our environmental footprint. At AstraZeneca, we’re driving deep decarbonisation across our value chain through our flagship Ambition Zero Carbon strategy .",AstraZeneca Sustainability Report 2023.pdf,Does the company have a specific process in place to identify risks arising from climate change?,A TCFD Steering Group with cross-functional membership has oversight of the physical and transitional risks and opportunities posed to AstraZeneca by climate change.

5,"At AstraZeneca, we’re driving deep decarbonisation across our value chain through our flagship Ambition Zero Carbon strategy . We’re investing $1 billion to reduce emissions from the lab to the patient and are integrating more circular approaches into the discovery, development and delivery of medicines with the latest digital technologies and innovation. We’re also restoring nature and supporting biodiversity through our AZ Forest programme, which expanded in 2023 to a $400 million  initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030. Learning from scientific and ecological experts and local communities is central to our approach, with 19.9 million trees planted to date.  We embed this collaboration mindset across all of our sustainability efforts, recognising that when we come together, we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero. We want people to live their healthiest lives, wherever they live.  The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health  Systems Task Force is a public-private partnership we’re proud to convene which focuses on accelerating the transition to net zero health systems. In 2023, we launched joint  environmental targets for suppliers, saw the establishment of a China Health Working Group, and recently concluded a multi-party agreement to access renewable power in China.

6,"The Partnership for Health System  Sustainability and Resilience is a further example of our commitment. Together with partners, we’re delivering evidence-based recommendations which are leading to policy reforms to strengthen health systems. For example, in Italy, clinical pathways for chronic diseases are being reviewed to identify the investments needed; in Japan, a digital medical information platform is being prioritised; and in Brazil, the improvement of community-based prevention and disease management services is now a key area of focus. These are three of the 40 countries in which our Young Health  Programme is active. Here, we’re empowering young people to make healthier choices and have directly engaged over 15 million young people on non-communicable disease risk factors since 2010.  Improving health system sustainability is  also central to our flagship Healthy Heart Africa  programme. In collaboration with nine African governments and partners, we’re working to prevent and control hypertension and decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease.

It’s the bedrock of society, and when we’re healthy, communities thrive and economies prosper. Yet, with ageing populations, the rising burden of chronic disease and the growing impact of the climate crisis on health, health systems are struggling to meet people’s health needs. And around the world, inequities in healthcare are growing from low- to high-income countries, with vulnerable populations the most affected. We must recognise the strong correlation between healthy people and a healthy planet – the science is clear. The number of heat-related deaths could more than triple by 2050 without significant action, and we’re witnessing a steep rise in heart and metabolic conditions, cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to environmental factors. The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate-health crisis in 2023.  With the healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions, we must significantly reduce our environmental footprint.

We’re investing $1 billion to reduce emissions from the lab to the patient and are integrating more circular approaches into the discovery, development and delivery of medicines with the latest digital technologies and innovation. We’re also restoring nature and supporting biodiversity through our AZ Forest programme, which expanded in 2023 to a $400 million  initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030. Learning from scientific and ecological experts and local communities is central to our approach, with 19.9 million trees planted to date.  We embed this collaboration mindset across all of our sustainability efforts, recognising that when we come together, we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero. We want people to live their healthiest lives, wherever they live.  The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health  Systems Task Force is a public-private partnership we’re proud to convene which focuses on accelerating the transition to net zero health systems.

It’s the bedrock of society, and when we’re healthy, communities thrive and economies prosper. Yet, with ageing populations, the rising burden of chronic disease and the growing impact of the climate crisis on health, health systems are struggling to meet people’s health needs. And around the world, inequities in healthcare are growing from low- to high-income countries, with vulnerable populations the most affected. We must recognise the strong correlation between healthy people and a healthy planet – the science is clear. The number of heat-related deaths could more than triple by 2050 without significant action, and we’re witnessing a steep rise in heart and metabolic conditions, cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to environmental factors. The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate-health crisis in 2023.  With the healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions, we must significantly reduce our environmental footprint.

We’re investing $1 billion to reduce emissions from the lab to the patient and are integrating more circular approaches into the discovery, development and delivery of medicines with the latest digital technologies and innovation. We’re also restoring nature and supporting biodiversity through our AZ Forest programme, which expanded in 2023 to a $400 million  initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030. Learning from scientific and ecological experts and local communities is central to our approach, with 19.9 million trees planted to date.  We embed this collaboration mindset across all of our sustainability efforts, recognising that when we come together, we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero. We want people to live their healthiest lives, wherever they live.  The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health  Systems Task Force is a public-private partnership we’re proud to convene which focuses on accelerating the transition to net zero health systems.

Together with partners, we’re delivering evidence-based recommendations which are leading to policy reforms to strengthen health systems. For example, in Italy, clinical pathways for chronic diseases are being reviewed to identify the investments needed; in Japan, a digital medical information platform is being prioritised; and in Brazil, the improvement of community-based prevention and disease management services is now a key area of focus. These are three of the 40 countries in which our Young Health  Programme is active. Here, we’re empowering young people to make healthier choices and have directly engaged over 15 million young people on non-communicable disease risk factors since 2010.  Improving health system sustainability is  also central to our flagship Healthy Heart Africa  programme. In collaboration with nine African governments and partners, we’re working to prevent and control hypertension and decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease.

382,"Access to  healthcareEnvironmental protectionEthics and  transparency3Sustainability  overviewSustainability overviewChief Executive Officer’s statement When we come together,  we can transform the  delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero.Healthcare is our common foundation. It’s the bedrock of society, and when we’re healthy, communities thrive and economies prosper. Yet, with ageing populations, the rising burden of chronic disease and the growing impact of the climate crisis on health, health systems are struggling to meet people’s health needs. And around the world, inequities in healthcare are growing from low- to high-income countries, with vulnerable populations the most affected. We must recognise the strong correlation between healthy people and a healthy planet – the science is clear. The number of heat-related deaths could more than triple by 2050 without significant action, and we’re witnessing a steep rise in heart and metabolic conditions, cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to environmental factors. The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate-health crisis in 2023.  With the healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions, we must significantly reduce our environmental footprint.

383,"At AstraZeneca, we’re driving deep decarbonisation across our value chain through our flagship Ambition Zero Carbon strategy . We’re investing $1 billion to reduce emissions from the lab to the patient and are integrating more circular approaches into the discovery, development and delivery of medicines with the latest digital technologies and innovation. We’re also restoring nature and supporting biodiversity through our AZ Forest programme, which expanded in 2023 to a $400 million  initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030. Learning from scientific and ecological experts and local communities is central to our approach, with 19.9 million trees planted to date.  We embed this collaboration mindset across all of our sustainability efforts, recognising that when we come together, we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero. We want people to live their healthiest lives, wherever they live.  The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health  Systems Task Force is a public-private partnership we’re proud to convene which focuses on accelerating the transition to net zero health systems. In 2023, we launched joint  environmental targets for suppliers, saw the establishment of a China Health Working Group, and recently concluded a multi-party agreement to access renewable power in China.

384,"The Partnership for Health System  Sustainability and Resilience is a further example of our commitment. Together with partners, we’re delivering evidence-based recommendations which are leading to policy reforms to strengthen health systems. For example, in Italy, clinical pathways for chronic diseases are being reviewed to identify the investments needed; in Japan, a digital medical information platform is being prioritised; and in Brazil, the improvement of community-based prevention and disease management services is now a key area of focus. These are three of the 40 countries in which our Young Health  Programme is active. Here, we’re empowering young people to make healthier choices and have directly engaged over 15 million young people on non-communicable disease risk factors since 2010.  Improving health system sustainability is  also central to our flagship Healthy Heart Africa  programme. In collaboration with nine African governments and partners, we’re working to prevent and control hypertension and decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease. Over nine million people with elevated blood pressure have been identified to date, helping reduce  the pressure on health services.At AstraZeneca, we’re guided by our Values  and commitment to ethics and transparency.

Preventing serious injury  and fatality at workWe launched a Serious Injury and Fatality Prevention and Mitigation Programme in 2021, led by our Global SHE team and guided by a senior-level steering committee. Process and life safety subject matter experts evaluate high-risk activities with the potential to result in a serious injury or fatality and prioritise these against internal audit findings and past events. In 2023 we implemented the final year of our three-year plan to address 12 high-risk areas, focusing on process safety management, explosive atmospheres and instrumented protective systems. Besides reviewing and uplifting existing standards and materials, followed by a gap assessment at site-level, we have now also included questions for leaders to ask during routine workplace interactions, to provide process confirmation. This involves leaders watching the process and engaging with those who do the work to learn if there are further improvement opportunities.

It’s the bedrock of society, and when we’re healthy, communities thrive and economies prosper. Yet, with ageing populations, the rising burden of chronic disease and the growing impact of the climate crisis on health, health systems are struggling to meet people’s health needs. And around the world, inequities in healthcare are growing from low- to high-income countries, with vulnerable populations the most affected. We must recognise the strong correlation between healthy people and a healthy planet – the science is clear. The number of heat-related deaths could more than triple by 2050 without significant action, and we’re witnessing a steep rise in heart and metabolic conditions, cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to environmental factors. The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate-health crisis in 2023.  With the healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions, we must significantly reduce our environmental footprint.

We’re investing $1 billion to reduce emissions from the lab to the patient and are integrating more circular approaches into the discovery, development and delivery of medicines with the latest digital technologies and innovation. We’re also restoring nature and supporting biodiversity through our AZ Forest programme, which expanded in 2023 to a $400 million  initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030. Learning from scientific and ecological experts and local communities is central to our approach, with 19.9 million trees planted to date.  We embed this collaboration mindset across all of our sustainability efforts, recognising that when we come together, we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero. We want people to live their healthiest lives, wherever they live.  The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health  Systems Task Force is a public-private partnership we’re proud to convene which focuses on accelerating the transition to net zero health systems.

Together with partners, we’re delivering evidence-based recommendations which are leading to policy reforms to strengthen health systems. For example, in Italy, clinical pathways for chronic diseases are being reviewed to identify the investments needed; in Japan, a digital medical information platform is being prioritised; and in Brazil, the improvement of community-based prevention and disease management services is now a key area of focus. These are three of the 40 countries in which our Young Health  Programme is active. Here, we’re empowering young people to make healthier choices and have directly engaged over 15 million young people on non-communicable disease risk factors since 2010.  Improving health system sustainability is  also central to our flagship Healthy Heart Africa  programme.
